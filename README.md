# CodeMyGen-Workshops

**CodeMyGen** is a hands-on bioinformatics workshop series led by Computer Science and Biotechnology Engineering students, @GenoBit members as well, focused on learning by doing for the audience and learning by teaching for the contributors abd mentors. Our mission is to demystify bioinformatics and make computational tools accessible to students from diverse backgrounds who are curious about life sciences, data and code.


## Objectives

- Introduce bioinformatics concepts in a clear and beginner-friendly way
- Teach programming applied to biological data (genomics, sequences, datasets)
- Promote interdisciplinary collaboration between engineering, biology, and data science students
- Encourage learning by teaching, problem-solving, and scientific thinking


## Target Audience

These workshops were designed for:

- Students with no prior bioinformatics experience
- Computer science / software students interested in biology & health
- Biotechnology, biology, or life sciences students wanting to learn programming
- Anyone curious about how code helps us understand life


## Contents

The workshop series follows a progressive learning path:

- **Workshop 0 – Hello RStudio**  
  Variables, loops, functions, and basic data structures adapted for biological data

- **Workshop 1 – Hello Bioinformatics, in R**  
  Data Manipulation, Inspection, cleaning process and Data visualization.

- **Workshop 2 – Making sense of sequencess**  
  Breaking into DNA and RNA, FASTA files, GC Content, Motifs, Aminoacids frequency.

- **Workshop 3 – Harmony in Data through Apply Functions**  
  apply(), lapply(), sapply(), tapply(), mapply().
